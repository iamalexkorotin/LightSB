# Light SchrÃ¶dinger Bridge

This repository contains code to reproduce the experiments from our work (LightSB). PyTorch implementation.

Unpaired Male -> Female translation by our LightSB solver applied in the latent space of ALAE for 1024x1024 FFHQ images. Our LightSB converges on 4 cpu cores in less than 1 minute.

## Repository structure:
All the experiments are issued in the form of pretty self-explanatory jupyter notebooks (`notebooks/`). For convenience, the majority of the evaluation output is preserved. Auxilary source code is moved to `.py` modules (`src/`). 

Note that we use `wandb` ([link](https://wandb.ai/site)) dashboard system when launching our experiments. The practitioners are expected to use `wandb` too.
